      <div class="Heading1"><a name="1237815">About Image Compression </a></div>
      <div class="Subhead1"><a name="1237890">Introduction</a></div>
      <div class="Text"><a name="1237918">Digital imagery is becoming more and more ubiquitous as time goes by. With </a>the proliferation of means whereby image data can be obtained (digital cameras, satellite imaging, image scanning) there is now a vast amount of image data in use, all of which consumes valuable storage and bandwidth resources. The need to use datastore and bandwidth resources more efficiently is what drives the field of image compression. Image compression refers to a whole raft of techniques to encode image data for the purpose of reducing its size for easier transmission or persistence. A compressed image has undergone such encoding. The goal of an image compression scheme is to achieve the maximum possible degree of image file exchange and storage efficiency whilst preserving a minimum level of fidelity in the image that results after reconstruction from the compressed format. </div>
      <div class="Text"><a name="1237903">Currently the most effective compression techniques that have been found for </a>imagery employ frequency transforms, and of these, the most effective are wavelet based, employing the discrete wavelet transform to process a digital image into sub-bands prior to quantization and coding. Wavelet based compression results in very high compression ratios, whilst maintaining a correspondingly high degree of fidelity and quality in a reconstructed image. With advances in the processing power of ordinary computers, a compressed image may be used almost anywhere an uncompressed image can; the image, or required section of the image, is simply decompressed on the fly before being displayed, printed or processed. </div>
      <div class="Text"><a name="1237904">Typically, a color image such as an airphoto can be compressed to less than </a>5% of its original size (20:1 compression ratio or better). At 20:1 compression, a 10GB color image compresses down to 500MB in size. This size is small enough to be stored on a CD-ROM. Images with less information can achieve even greater compression ratios. For example, ratios of 100:1 or greater are not uncommon for compressed topographic maps. Because the compressed imagery is composed of multi-resolution wavelet levels, you can experience fast roaming and zooming on the imagery, even on slower media such as CD-ROM.This chapter discusses image compression issues, and describes the ECW (Enhanced Compression Wavelet) method. </div>
      <div class="Subhead1"><a name="1237930">Lossless or Lossy Compression </a></div>
      <div class="Text"><a name="1237939">Lossless compression provides a compressed image that can uncompress to </a>an identical copy of the original image. This perfect reconstruction is the advantage of lossless compression. The disadvantage of lossless compression is a ratio limit of approximately 2:1 compressed file size. </div>
      <div class="Text"><a name="1237955">Lossy compression provides a compressed image that can uncompress to an </a>approximate copy of the original image. </div>
      <div class="Text"><a name="1237963">Lossy compression sacrifices some data fidelity, in order to achieve much </a>higher compression rates than those available through lossless compression. This higher compression capability is the advantage of lossy compression. </div>
      <div class="Subhead1"><a name="1237931">Wavelet Based Encoding </a></div>
      <div class="Text"><a name="1237926">The most effective form of compression today is wavelet based image </a>encoding. This technique is very effective at retaining data accuracy within highly compressed files. Unlike JPEG, which uses a block-based discrete cosine transformation (DCT) on blocks across the image, modern wavelet compression techniques enable compressions of 20:1 or greater, without visible degradation of the original image. Wavelet compression can also be used to generate lossless compressed imagery, at ratios of around 2:1. </div>
      <div class="Text"><a name="1237972">Wavelet compression involves a way of analyzing an uncompressed image in </a>a recursive manner. This analysis results in a series of sequentially higher resolution images, each augmenting the information in the lower resolution images. </div>

      <div class="Text"><a name="1237977">Wavelet images are not compressed images as such. Rather, it is the </a>quantization and encoding stages that provide the image compression. Image decompression, or reconstruction, is achieved by completing the above steps in reverse order. Thus, to restore an original image, the compressed image is decoded, dequantized, and then an inverse DWT is performed. </div>
      <div class="Text"><a name="1237978">Wavelet mathematics embraces an entire range of methods, each offering </a>different properties and advantages. Wavelet compression has not been widely used because the DWT operation consumes heavy processing power, and because most implementations perform DWT operations in memory, or by storing intermediate results on a hard disk. This limits the speed or the size of image compression. The ECW wavelet compression uses a breakthrough new technique for performing the DWT and inverse-DWT operations (patent pending). ECW makes wavelet-based compression a practical reality. </div>
      <div class="Text"><a name="1237982">Because wavelet compression inherently results in a set of multi-resolution </a>images, it is suitable for working with large imagery, to be viewed at different resolutions.

      <div class="Text"><a name="1238134">JPEG 2000 can operate in four modes: hierarchical, lossless, progressive or </a>sequential. These modes are flexibly specified within the JPEG 2000 standard, which allows complex interactions between them, such as mixing hierarchical and progressive methods within a code-stream. Quality and resolution are both scalable, with different granularities corresponding to each level of access in an image. As a viewer randomly selects spatial regions, they can be transmitted and decoded at varying resolution and quality levels. Maximum resolution and size is chosen at compression time, but subsequent decompression or recompression can provide any level of image quality or resolution, up to the compression threshold. For example, an image compressed losslessly with JPEG 2000 can be subsequently decompressed at some lesser resolution to extract a lossy decompressed image. This extracted lossy image is identical to the image obtained when lossy compression is used on the original image. Therefore, you can decode and extract desired images without needing to decode the entire code-stream or source image file. The selected subset of image data will be identical to that obtained if only the selected data had been compressed in the first instance. </div>
